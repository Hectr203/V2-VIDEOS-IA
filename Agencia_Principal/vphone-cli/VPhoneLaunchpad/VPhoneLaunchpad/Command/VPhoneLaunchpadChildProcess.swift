/// A started child process whose merged stdout and stderr arrive line by line
/// on a background thread.
///
/// Two output modes:
/// - A pipe, for commands that finish. Output ends when every holder of the
///   pipe has closed it.
/// - A log file, for `vm launch`. The guest must outlive Launchpad: with a
///   pipe, quitting the app would close the read end and the next line of
///   guest serial output would kill the VM with SIGPIPE. The file is tailed
///   while the app runs and stays behind as the machine's console log.
///   The guest is also detached: it gets its own session and Launchpad
///   disclaims responsibility for it, so macOS does not keep Launchpad listed
///   as running in the background after the app quits.
///
///   What is started detached is `vphone-launchpad-launcher` from the app's
///   Contents/MacOS, with `vphone-cli` and its arguments after it. The
///   launcher is responsible for itself and starts `vphone-cli` without
///   disclaiming, so it is responsible for `vphone-vm` and its Virtualization
///   service. macOS ties a privacy permission (microphone, location) to the
///   responsible process's signature. `vphone-cli` is signed ad hoc, so every
///   bundle build would be asked again. A tool in the app's Contents/MacOS
///   is attributed to the app, so the request is the app's and is asked
///   once for its Developer ID signature; under the hardened runtime the app
///   needs the matching entitlement (Resources/VPhoneLaunchpad.entitlements).
///   Without the launcher (previews, a build that lacks it) or for a
///   `vphone-cli` it would refuse, Launchpad starts `vphone-cli` directly,
///   responsible for itself as before.
