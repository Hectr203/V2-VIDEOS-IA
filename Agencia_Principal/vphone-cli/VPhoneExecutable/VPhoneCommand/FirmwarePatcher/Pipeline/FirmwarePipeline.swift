// FirmwarePipeline.swift — Orchestrates full boot-chain firmware patching.
//
// Historical note: this file replaces the old Python firmware patcher implementation.
//
// Pipeline order: AVPBooter → iBSS → iBEC → LLB → TXM → Kernel → DeviceTree
//
// Internal variant selection:
//   .regular — base patchers only
//   .dev     — TXMDevPatcher instead of TXMPatcher
//   .jb      — TXMDevPatcher + IBootCustomFirmwarePatcher (iBSS) + KernelCustomFirmwarePatcher
//              + former EXP kernel and DeviceTree patches. The case keeps its old
//              spelling because its raw value is recorded in every VM's RestoreInfo.
//   .exp     — historical internal variant, currently equivalent to CFW for
//              the boot-chain patcher catalogue. Only CFW is public.
//
// The component catalogue lives in FirmwarePipelineComponents.swift and the
// Restore-directory/firmware-file lookup in FirmwarePipelineDiscovery.swift.
